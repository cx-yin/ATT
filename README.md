# ATT: Adaptive Algorithms for Tensor Train Decomposition of Streaming Tensors

We propose a novel adaptive algorithm for TT decomposition of streaming tensors whose slices are serially acquired over time. By
leveraging the alternating minimization framework, our estimator minimizes an exponentially weighted least-squares cost function
in an efficient way. 


## Dependencies
